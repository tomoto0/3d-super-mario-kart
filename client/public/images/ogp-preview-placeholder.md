# OGP Preview Image Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Open Graph Protocol (OGP) preview image.

The actual image file `ogp-preview.jpg` should contain:
- Game logo or title
- Screenshot of gameplay
- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (recommended for social media)

This image appears when the game is shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.

## To replace:
1. Create or obtain a 1200x630 pixel image
2. Save as `ogp-preview.jpg` in this directory
3. Update this README if needed
